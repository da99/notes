Well... that's brilliant.  

But, (bear with me) doesn't this mean that the hard part is (relatively speaking) not scientific exploration, but in getting people to "yearn" beyond the boundaries?

In other words: Shipbuilders vs explorers: one builds ships, the other demands better ships.  Most of the education programs I've seen get people to understand already accepted knowledge (shipbuilders), but I haven't seen anything to get people to yearn to be the next Faraday (explorer). In fact, if the next Faraday did come about, they would most likely be shunned as a crackpot. Not because of their academic pedigree, but because their ideas would contradict the professors in power. 


A few years back, I wondered: Why is it I believe in things no else agrees with?

I seemed to look at the different
schools of thought, pick the best one that answers as many questions
as possible, and believe in it until something better comes along (ie can it
  solve more problems than the previous school of thought).
(But, I was at least somewhat aware it was not scientific or scholarly.
 A combination of logic, emotion, and preferences.)

My peers in HS who went on to higher education
(Stanford, Yale, Harvard, Worchester, MIT, etc.,)
  agree with the status quo, work within it, and have careers, children, so on.
  (Nothing wrong with that and there is no professional jealously on my part.)

Professionally, I suspect they are shipbuilders, who are treated as explorers.
Scientific researchers who find
lousy hacks and turn them into over-priced drugs with dangerous side-effects.

You, however, take on the far superior approach to accumulating and developing
new knowledge. However, it seems to come more naturally to you than to your peers.

How was Faraday able to contribute so much to science and tech.
despite the vast resources of the classical educated members of
The Royal Institution and Royal Society?
I just assumed it was a combination of his idiosyncies that allowed him
to view things differently. Something difficult to teach because
it goes against one's own personality.  (Faraday, guided partly by his
    religious background, even refused to
  develop weapons, in contrast to Feynman's work on the Manhattan Project.)

How would you describe today's scientific progress? Do you see stagnation
like we see in the computer-related fields? Are some countries more
captivated by your lectures than others? Or is it on a university-by-university
basis?
