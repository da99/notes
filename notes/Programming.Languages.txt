* OCaml:
  1) No method overloading with different types.
  2) Easy at first, but gets harder for me to learn.
  3) Fast compiler, but Crystal has ADTs and patter matching.
     * Speed gains of compiler are wiped out by harder to use.

* Nim: still too buggy with C's undefined behaviour (0.17.2)

* D, DART: not as easy to use as Crystal

* Compile time verification of HTML:
  * See html.cr README.md: Just use unit tests and give up on macros and types
  for HTML verification.
