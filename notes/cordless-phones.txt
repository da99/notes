   Because the wretched generation which has grown up since the invention
   of the mobile has never grasped the idea that a phone actually belongs
   in a specific place. When they finish a call, the young do not return a
   cordless phone to its base, as we do, unthinkingly: they simply leave
   it lying around at random, typically down the back of a sofa. Every
   time the telephone rings, you have to hunt around wondering where the
   muffled noise is coming from. Hence the need for the traditional,
   immobile phone.

Comment: People forget to do a simple task: Put back the telephone.
         Remember, even smart people will act like Homer Simpsons
         most of the time.
